## Hardware
- Raspberry Pi Zero W with soldered pin headers.
- 4GB (or larger) microSD card
- Optional: case for the Pi Zero W
- Waveshare 2.13inch E-Ink display HAT (monochrome)

### Adapters
For setting up the Raspberry Pi (getting it on your wifi), you will need a USB OTG cable for the keyboard and mini-HDMI cable.  Some Pi Zero W kits come with these cables or you might have them already.  

### Screens
Waveshare makes a few sizes of e-paper displays.  The 2.13inch is the exact size of the Raspberry Pi Zero W and the monochrome version has a very quick refresh rate.
